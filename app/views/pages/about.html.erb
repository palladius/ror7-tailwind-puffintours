<h1>About us</h1>

<p>This was highly wanted by my waffle, to be able to rate my ability to support the family in our trips.
    Basically my wife split our jobs pretty evenly:<br/>
    * I (the father) would go into finding places to eat, to visit and so on<br/>
    * My wife would rate me with 1 to 5 stars at the end of the trip.<br/>
