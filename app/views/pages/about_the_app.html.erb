<h3>The Code</h3>

Gems: <br/>

ğŸ”· A number of gems are used to render HTML with videos and stuff. Notably, 99% of it is useless since I found out a
  great article to render videos on ActiveStorage<br/>

<pre>gem 'html-pipeline'
gem 'html-pipeline-trix-video' # BAD: https://github.com/HazelGrant/html-pipeline-trix-video
gem 'html-pipeline-youtube'
gem 'html-pipeline-vimeo'
gem 'html-pipeline-wiki-link'
gem 'commonmarker'
gem 'rouge'
gem 'sanitize'
gem 'rinku'
gem 'gemoji'
</pre>

ğŸ”· gem 'guard-livereload' and gem 'listen' for local degv auto-reload. Wow!<br/>
ğŸ”· gem 'acts-as-taggable-on' to manage tags<br/>
ğŸ”· gem 'acts_as_votable' to manage votes/likes (but I believe I wont use it now that the vote is in the "comment" model)<br/>
ğŸ”· gem 'lolcat' to make life like a rainbow! <br/>
ğŸ”· gem "google-cloud-storage", gem 'googleauth' for ActiveStorage to work on GCP<br/>
ğŸ”· gem "chartkick" (and his friends gem "groupdate",  gem 'active_median') for charts on main page <br/>
ğŸ”· gem langchainrb (to inject some GenAI - like auto-summarize stuff).
